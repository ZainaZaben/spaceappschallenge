    <h1>Everything Starts with Water</h1>
    <p>Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local,
        regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the
        term.</p>
    <p>Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly
        fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s
        average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also
        contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La
        Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Sun’s
        energy output, variations in Earth’s orbit).
    </p>
    <p>Scientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with computer models, to monitor and study
        past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key
        indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth’s poles
        and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves,
        wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes.
    </p>
    <p>“Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the
        terms "weather" and "climate" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different
        spatial- and timescales.</p>
